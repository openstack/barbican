Install and configure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes how to install and configure the
Key Manager service, code-named barbican, on the controller node.

This section assumes that you already have a working OpenStack
environment with at least the Identity Service (keystone) installed.

For simplicity, this configuration stores secrets on the local
file system.

Note that installation and configuration vary by distribution.
